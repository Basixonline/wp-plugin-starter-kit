Finally there is a tool to make wordpress plugin development a little less complicated

== Description ==
Are you tired of:
* Repetitive coding
* Searching through old code to get new work out
* Code restructuring
* Code cleanup
* Long hours

After 14 years of development most of the above drove me crazy and I decided to create something that basically almost creates, or does my work for me.

XPSK is what I came up with and to this day its literally saving me months of time and frustration and gives me the ability to make money quickly and effectively.

Certainly the needs for most plugin developers are to impress clients with back-end functionality in other words plugins:

* That has high quality;
* Like WordPress itself, are user friendly;
* That looks good;
* That gives a quick response to any input action;
* and in turn impress there users

...well, this platform provides all of the above needs!

Have fun
